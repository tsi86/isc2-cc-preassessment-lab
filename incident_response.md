## What is an Incident?

An **incident** is any event that negatively affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of an organizationâ€™s information or systems.

Examples:
- Unauthorized access
- Malware infections
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Data breaches

## The Incident Response Lifecycle

According to NIST SP 800-61, the lifecycle has 4 phases:

1. **Preparation**  
   - Define policies and procedures  
   - Train staff and test IR plans  
   - Deploy security tools and monitoring

2. **Detection and Analysis**  
   - Identify signs of incidents (alerts, logs, user reports)  
   - Prioritize and analyze the scope and impact

3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**  
   - Stop the attack (e.g., isolate infected systems)  
   - Remove malicious files or users  
   - Restore systems and monitor

4. **Post-Incident Activity**  
   - Conduct lessons learned  
   - Update incident response plans and documentation  
   - Report findings to management

## Incident Response Team (IRT)

Roles may include:
- Incident Manager
- Analysts (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- Forensics Specialist
- Legal / Compliance representative

---

## Goals of Incident Response

- Minimize damage and recovery time
- Maintain business continuity
- Improve future detection and response
- Comply with legal and regulatory requirements

## Summary

Effective incident response helps reduce the impact of cyber threats and strengthens overall security posture. Having a documented plan and a trained team is essential.

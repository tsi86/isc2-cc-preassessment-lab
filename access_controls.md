## Types of Access Controls

- **Administrative Controls** – Policies and procedures (e.g., security training, background checks)
- **Technical (Logical) Controls** – Technology-based (e.g., firewalls, authentication)
- **Physical Controls** – Physical barriers (e.g., locks, security guards, CCTV)

## Access Control Models

- **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)** – Data owner decides who gets access.
- **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)** – Access is based on classifications (e.g., Top Secret).
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** – Access based on the user’s role.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** – Access based on attributes (user, resource, environment).

## Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA)

- **Authentication** – Verifying identity (e.g., username + password)
- **Authorization** – Determining what actions are allowed.
- **Accounting** – Tracking activity for auditing and accountability.

## Summary

Access control mechanisms are essential to limit unauthorized access, enforce least privilege, and ensure proper accountability.

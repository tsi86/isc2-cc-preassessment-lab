## CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** represents the core principles of information security:

- **Confidentiality** – Ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
- **Integrity** – Ensuring that information is accurate and unaltered.
- **Availability** – Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed.

## Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risk

- A **threat** is a potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm.
- A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
- **Risk** is the combination of the probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the impact of that exploitation.

**Formula**:  
`Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact`

## Security Roles

- **User** – Responsible for following policies and using resources appropriately.
- **Owner** – Accountable for data classification and protection.
- **Custodian** – Manages and protects the data (e.g., sysadmins).
- **Security Administrator** – Implements and enforces security controls.

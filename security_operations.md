# Security Operations

This file summarizes the core principles of Security Operations from the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) course.

## What Are Security Operations?

Security Operations refers to the continuous monitoring, detection, analysis, and response to security threats in an organization.

## Security Operations Center (SOC)

A **SOC** is a centralized unit that deals with security issues at the organizational and technical level.

### SOC Functions:
- 24/7 monitoring of systems and networks
- Incident detection and response
- Threat intelligence analysis
- Log collection and correlation

---

## Common Tools Used in Security Operations

- **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) – e.g., Splunk, QRadar, Elastic  
- **EDR** (Endpoint Detection and Response) – monitors endpoints for suspicious activity  
- **SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) – automates repetitive tasks  
- **Firewall / IDS / IPS** – network protection and monitoring

---

## Key Concepts

### Least Privilege  
Grant users only the access they need, nothing more.

### Defense in Depth  
Layered security measures at multiple levels (e.g., network, application, endpoint).

### Logging and Monitoring  
Track system and user activity to detect anomalies.

### Patching  
Apply updates to fix vulnerabilities in systems and software.

## Metrics in Security Operations

- **MTTD** – Mean Time to Detect  
- **MTTR** – Mean Time to Respond  
- **False positives/negatives** – Accuracy of detection  
- **Coverage** – % of infrastructure under active monitoring

## Summary

Security operations are the backbone of a modern cybersecurity program. A proactive approach, supported by strong tools and trained analysts, makes the difference in preventing and mitigating attacks.
